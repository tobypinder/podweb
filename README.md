Podweb
=========

Podweb is a web based podcast manager and player built using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, and jQuery.

Currently, when I push commits, I push to both github and heroku, so http://podweb.herokuapp.com will mirror the master branch.
Anyone is free to use this code, however, to create their own version.

Podweb makes use of the following:
* [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap)
* [Omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth)
* [Feedjira](https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira)

And was generated with the [rails_apps_composer](https://github.com/RailsApps/rails_apps_composer) gem provided by the [RailsApps Project](http://railsapps.github.io/).
