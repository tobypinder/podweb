Podweb
=========

Podweb is a web based podcast manager and player built using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, and jQuery.

Currently, when I push commits, I push to both github and heroku, so http://podweb.herokuapp.com will mirror the master branch.
Anyone is free to use this code, however, to create their own version.

* [Feedjira](https://github.com/feedjira/feedjira)

And was generated with [Rails Composer](http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/).
